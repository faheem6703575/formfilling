You are analyzing a European Union project funding document for budgetary institutions. Extract ALL information with EXTREME PRECISION.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Working week length should be 5 for "5-day work schedule" (NOT 40 hours)
2. Annual leave rates must be calculated from this reference table:
   - 20 days = 8.63%, 21-25 days = 10.44%, 26-30 days = 12.35%
   - 31-36 days = 14.99%, 37-39 days = 17.25%, 40 days = 18.89%, 41+ days = 20.02%
3. Extract salary coefficient information (e.g., "coefficient 11", "coefficient 9")
4. Extract detailed bonus breakdowns (e.g., "15% expertise bonus + 10% performance allowance")
5. Calculate increase amounts correctly including bonuses in base calculation
6. For organization type, identify if it's "Budgetary" or "Businesses, etc."

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or mathematical expressions in values.

IMPORTANT: All numerical values must be calculated numbers, not expressions like "440 / 3" or "(2650 + 265) * 0.05".

Example of CORRECT format:
"allowances_bonuses": 146.67 (NOT "440 / 3")
"increase_amount": 145.75 (NOT "(2650 + 265) * 0.05")

Return valid JSON only:

{
  "project_info": {
    "project_code": "exact project code from text",
    "organization_name": "exact organization name", 
    "project_duration_months": number,
    "contribution_rate": number (budgetary = 0.014, businesses = 0.046),
    "organization_type": "Ministry/Institute/University/Company etc.",
    "budgetary_classification": "budgetary" or "non-budgetary"
  },

      "action_expenditure_type": "1.2.1 or similar pattern", 
      "job_title": "exact job title",
      "planned_posts": number (can be decimal like 0.5),
      "employment_contract": "time-limited/indefinite/etc",

      "allowances_bonuses": number,
      "increase_percentage": number as decimal (5% = 0.05),
      "increase_amount": number (calculate as (salary+bonuses)*percentage and provide the final number),
      "working_week_length": 5 (for 5-day week) or 6 (for 6-day week),
      "annual_leave_days": number,
      "annual_leave_allowance_rate": number (use reference table above),
      "justification": "complete justification text",
      "coefficient": "extract coefficient info like 'coefficient 11'",
      "bonus_breakdown": "detailed breakdown like '15% expertise + 10% performance'"
    }
  ]
}

EXTRACTION RULES:
- If text mentions "5-day work schedule", set working_week_length = 5
- If text mentions "coefficient X", extract the coefficient number
- For increases, calculate as (salary + bonuses) * percentage
- Use exact annual leave rates from the table based on leave days
- Extract every single position mentioned, even if similar
- For budgetary organizations, contribution_rate = 0.014
- For non-budgetary organizations, contribution_rate = 0.046
- Be extremely precise with all numerical values
- DO NOT wrap response in markdown code blocks or ``` - return pure JSON only

Extract EVERY detail mentioned in the text. Do not assume or approximate values.
