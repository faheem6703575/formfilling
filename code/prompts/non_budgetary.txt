You are analyzing a European Union project funding document for budgetary institutions. Extract ALL information with EXTREME PRECISION.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Working week length should be 5 for "5-day work schedule" (NOT 40 hours)
2. Annual leave rates must be calculated from this reference table:
   - 20 days = 8.63%, 21-25 days = 10.44%, 26-30 days = 12.35%
   - 31-36 days = 14.99%, 37-39 days = 17.25%, 40 days = 18.89%, 41+ days = 20.02%
3. Extract salary coefficient information (e.g., "coefficient 11", "coefficient 9")
4. Extract detailed bonus breakdowns (e.g., "15% expertise bonus + 10% performance allowance")
5. Calculate increase amounts correctly including bonuses in base calculation
6. For organization type, identify if it's "Budgetary" or "Businesses, etc."

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or mathematical expressions in values.

IMPORTANT: All numerical values must be calculated numbers, not expressions like "440 / 3" or "(2650 + 265) * 0.05".

Example of CORRECT format:
"allowances_bonuses": 146.67 (NOT "440 / 3")
"increase_amount": 145.75 (NOT "(2650 + 265) * 0.05")

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - EXACT FORM MAPPING:
1. Eil. No. - Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)
2. Project Impact No. (from the PIP) - Project impact identifier
3. No of action/expenditure type (from the IBP) - Action/expenditure type number
4. Duties in the ORP - Specific duties/responsibilities 
5. Position/Function in the institution - Job title/position
6. Employee's name - Name if specified (can be empty)
7. Type of employment contract - Contract type affecting unemployment insurance
8. Year for which remuneration is planned - Year or year range
9. Number of months/hours planned - Duration in months
10. Planned post salary/hourly rate, EUR - Base salary rate
11. Increase, % (if applicable) - Percentage increase as decimal
12. Amount of increase, EUR - Calculated increase amount
13. Total planned remuneration excluding employer's contribution, EUR - Formula: Column 10 + Column 12
14. Total rate including employer's contribution, EUR - Including contribution rate
15. Length of working week on weekdays - Working days per week (5 or 6)
16. Number of working days of annual leave - Annual leave days
17. Fixed rate of annual leave allowance - Rate from reference table
18. Planned cost of annual leave, EUR - Annual leave cost including contributions
19. Total planned R&D fee, EUR - Formula: Column 14 + Column 18
20. Total planned remuneration, EUR - Formula: Column 19 + Column 9
21. Justification of the salary rate - Detailed justification

CALCULATION FORMULAS:
- Column 13 = Column 10 + Column 12
- Column 19 = Column 14 + Column 18
- Column 20 = Column 19 + Column 9

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON without markdown formatting or mathematical expressions.

Return valid JSON only:

CALCULATION FORMULAS (ESSENTIAL):
- Total Excluding Contribution (N) = Planned Salary Rate (K) + Increase Amount (M)
- Total Including Contribution (O) = Total Excluding Contribution (N) × (1 + contribution_rate)
- Annual Leave Cost (S) = Total Including Contribution (O) × Annual Leave Rate (R)
- Total Planned R&D Fee (T) = Total Including Contribution (O) + Annual Leave Cost (S)
- Total Planned Remuneration (U) = Total Planned R&D Fee (T) + Months/Hours Planned (J)

ANNUAL LEAVE RATES:
20 days = 8.63%, 21-25 days = 10.44%, 26-30 days = 12.35%
31-36 days = 14.99%, 37-39 days = 17.25%, 40 days = 18.89%, 41+ days = 20.02%

ENHANCED INTELLIGENCE FEATURES:
- Detect organization type from context clues
- Infer missing information from similar positions
- Generate professional justifications with supporting calculations
- Handle multiple employees with different rates
- Account for salary increases and their effective dates

EXTRACTION RULES:
- If text mentions "5-day work schedule", set working_week_length = 5
- If text mentions "coefficient X", extract the coefficient number
- For increases, calculate as (salary + bonuses) * percentage
- Use exact annual leave rates from the table based on leave days
- Extract every single position mentioned, even if similar
- For budgetary organizations, contribution_rate = 0.014
- For non-budgetary organizations, contribution_rate = 0.046
- Be extremely precise with all numerical values
- DO NOT wrap response in markdown code blocks or ``` - return pure JSON only

Extract EVERY detail mentioned in the text. Do not assume or approximate values.
