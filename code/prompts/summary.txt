TABLE 1: R&D Activities by Impact (up to 10 entries)
For each R&D impact/activity, extract:
- serial_no: Sequential number (1-10)
- impact_name: Name/description of the R&D impact/activity
- direct_costs: Direct costs in EUR
- indirect_costs: Indirect costs in EUR (typically 7% of direct costs)
- total_costs: Total costs (direct + indirect)
- funding_requested: EU funding requested in EUR

TABLE 2: R&D Expenditure Categories (exactly 8 categories)
1. Salaries and wages of project staff and employer's liability costs
2. Mission expenses for project staff
3. Depreciation costs for tools and equipment
4. Expenditure for the acquisition of R&D services
5. Costs of contractual research, know-how and patents purchased or licensed from external sources
6. Materials, non-expendable inventories, stocks, etc., classified as current assets
7. Rental costs of equipment (other than equipment purchased with EU funds)
8. Rental expenses for buildings or premises allocated to activities

For each category, extract:
- category_id: Category number (1-8)
- category_title: Exact category title as listed above
- direct_costs: Direct costs in EUR
- funding_requested: EU funding requested in EUR

TABLE 3: Partner Breakdown (applicant + up to 3 partners)
For each partner, extract:
- partner_name: "Applicant", "Partner No 1", "Partner No 2", "Partner No 3"
- eligible_costs: Total eligible costs (direct + indirect) in EUR
- funding_requested: EU funding requested in EUR
- percentage: Percentage of total eligible costs

Additional calculations:
- indirect_cost_rate: Usually 7% (0.07) or 0%
- lines_4_5_amount: Sum of categories 4 and 5 amounts
- lines_4_5_percentage: Percentage of categories 4 and 5 in total
- heading_8_amount: Amount for heading 8 (building/premises rental)
- heading_8_percentage: Percentage for heading 8

CRITICAL: 
- Return only valid JSON, no markdown formatting
- Ensure all numeric values are numbers (not strings)
- Calculate indirect costs as 7% of direct costs (unless specified otherwise)
- Total costs = direct costs + indirect costs
- Funding requested typically 85% of total costs
- All percentages should sum to 100% in partner breakdown
- Minimum funding requirement: â‚¬40,000
