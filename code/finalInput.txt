--- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ---
TABLE1 indirect_costs for each impact: For TABLE1, the indirect_costs field refers to the overhead expenses that support the project but are not directly tied to a specific activity. These include items such as administration, utilities, rent, and other operational costs. In the Lithuanian R&D Excel forms, each project impact (such as scientific impact, economic impact, or societal impact) has both direct costs and indirect costs. Indirect costs are typically calculated as a fixed percentage of the eligible direct costs, usually between 10% and 25%, depending on the funding programme rules. For example, if the direct costs for “scientific publications” are €10,000, the indirect costs at 15% would be €1,500.

In the Lithuanian R&D Excel forms, each project impact (such as scientific impact, economic impact, or societal impact) has both direct costs and indirect costs. Indirect costs are typically calculated as a fixed percentage of the eligible direct costs, usually between 10% and 25%, depending on the funding programme rules. For example, if the direct costs for “scientific publications” are €10,000, the indirect costs at 15% would be €1,500.
TABLE2 category_title for each category: For TABLE2, the category_title field is the human-readable name for each budget category in the cost breakdown section of the form. Typical category titles include “Personnel costs,” “Equipment,” “Consumables,” “Travel & subsistence,” “Subcontracting,” and “Overheads.” These appear in the 1A attachment of the Lithuanian R&D Excel form and are essential for clearly defining where funds are allocated.


--- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ---
TABLE1 indirect_costs for each impact: For TABLE1, the indirect_costs field refers to the overhead expenses that support the project but are not directly tied to a specific activity. These include items such as administration, utilities, rent, and other operational costs. In the Lithuanian R&D Excel forms, each project impact (such as scientific impact, economic impact, or societal impact) has both direct costs and indirect costs. Indirect costs are typically calculated as a fixed percentage of the eligible direct costs, usually between 10% and 25%, depending on the funding programme rules.

TABLE3 funding_requested for each partner: For TABLE3, the funding_requested field specifies the exact amount each consortium partner is requesting from the Lithuanian R&D funding body. For example, UAB InoStartas might have a total budget of €100,000 but request €80,000 in funding, while Vilnius University might request €50,000 for a €50,000 budget. Alongside this, the percentage field in TABLE3 represents each partner’s share of the total project budget, calculated as funding requested divided by the total project budget, multiplied by 100. In the previous example, UAB InoStartas would account for 61.54% and Vilnius University for 38.46% of the funding share.
TABLE3 percentage for each partner: In TABLE3, the percentage for each partner represents that partner’s share of the total project budget expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by dividing the partner’s funding requested amount by the total project budget and then multiplying by 100. This field is important because Lithuanian R&D funding forms require not only the raw funding figures but also the proportion of the project each partner is responsible for financially. For example, if Partner A requests €80,000 from a total project budget of €130,000, their percentage would be  ( 80 , 000 ÷ 130 , 000 ) × 100 (80,000÷130,000)×100 = 61.54%, and if Partner B requests €50,000, their percentage would be 38.46%. These percentages help evaluators quickly understand how the budget is distributed across the consortium.
TABLE2 category_id for each category: For TABLE2 again, the category_id field is a numeric or coded identifier for each budget category, as defined in the official Lithuanian R&D form template. This ensures the funding system correctly maps each category during submission. For instance, “Personnel costs” may have an ID of 1, “Equipment” an ID of 2, “Consumables” an ID of 3, “Travel & subsistence” an ID of 4, “Subcontracting” an ID of 5, and “Overheads” an ID of 6.

Additional Information:
Lastly, the Additional Information section is a free-text field that can be used to include clarifications, justifications for unusual costs, special funding conditions, or notes on how certain values were derived. For example, you might note: “Indirect costs calculated at 15% of direct eligible costs according to Lithuanian R&D funding rules. Partner percentages rounded to the nearest 0.1%.”
