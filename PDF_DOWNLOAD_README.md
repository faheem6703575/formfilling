## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies Added
- `reportlab` - For PDF generation
- `openpyxl` - For Excel file processing (already present)
- `zipfile` - For creating ZIP packages (built-in)
- `io` - For memory buffers (built-in)

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation**: Checks if required data exists before generating downloads
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages with emojis

## Customization

### PDF Styling
The PDF generator uses custom styles defined in `pdf_generator.py`:

### File Organization
The ZIP packages organize files logically:

- Summary files for easy navigation

## Testing

You can test the PDF generation independently by running:
```bash
python pdf_generator.py
```

Or test the data downloader:
```bash
python data_downloader.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Generation Fails**
   - Ensure `reportlab` is installed: `pip install reportlab`
   - Check if session state has required data
   - Verify file permissions

2. **ZIP Creation Fails**
   - Check if output directories exist
   - Verify file paths are correct
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

3. **Download Buttons Don't Appear**
   - Complete at least the TRL analysis step
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify Streamlit is running properly

### Performance Tips
